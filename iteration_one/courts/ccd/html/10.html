	<SPAN LANG="en-GB">The vagueness of the term ‘</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>wholesalers</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">’
	as it appears in the Tribunal’s order is demonstrated when regard

	explain the meaning of the word. (See: </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>Fifth
	to Thirteenth Respondents’ Affidavit;</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
	para 28. Pleadings File p. 148-9).  The explanation serves to
	illustrate the inherent ambiguity of that word in the Tribunal’s
	order.  In the first sentence Complainants state that wholesalers
	“</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>must be defined in the context of
	the industry where it is used to refer to wholesalers who are
	registered as such with the South African Pharmacy Council</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">”.
	 No evidence was given of this alleged customary usage in the

	to such usage in its decision.  However, in the very next sentence
	Complainants add another element to the definition of “</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>wholesalers</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">”,
	namely that they must have been wholesalers “</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>with
	whom the manufacturers did business before</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">”.
	 The following sentence refers to yet a further element, namely that
	the word refers both to full-line and short-line wholesalers. 
	Finally Complainants revert to an interpretation of “</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>wholesalers</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">”

	wholesalers</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">”.</SPAN></P>

	contend that the Tribunal’s order frustrates the clear purpose of
	the Competition Act as set out in sec. 2 thereof in two ways. 
	Firstly, prior to the advent of Seventh Appellant, most of the
	Appellants supplied their products to the Complainants at a standard
	17.5% discount off list price.  It is common cause that this
	discount rate has been an industry norm for over 25 years,
	irrespective of the fluctuating forces of supply and demand for the
	various pharmaceutical manufacturers’ products.  This price
	structure was thus, potentially, at least, an historical anomaly
	which is no longer commercially justifiable.  (See: Founding
	affidavit, para 9.2.2.1 and the references there cited; Pleadings
	file, p. 27)</FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
	</P>
	<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>It
	was argued that the concerted practice of the Complainants in
	requiring this standard discount rate from manufacturers constitutes
	an agreement to fix prices in violation of s 4(1)(b)(i) of the
	Competition Act.  Accordingly, if the Principals were required to
	sell all their products to the Complainants at this same rate, there
	would be a reversion to this unlawful conduct on the part of the
	wholesalers.</FONT></P>

	<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.03in; line-height: 150%">
	<SPAN LANG="en-GB">The Complainants responded in their answering
	affidavit that the 17.5% discount was merely a base rate, off which
	additional promotional and early settlement discounts were granted
	(See: para. 31.2; Pleadings file, p. 152).  This reply does not
	satisfactorily answer the criticism as the mere use of a base price
	list in this manner may well constitute horizontal price fixing.

	<SPAN LANG="en-GB">Secondly, the Tribunal’s order may require the
	Appellants to sell products to the Complainants and other
	wholesalers on terms and conditions preferential to those offered to
	their other customers.  There is no meaningful distinction between
	these two classes of customers.  Even as between wholesalers
	themselves, the order may, depending on the definition of 
	“</SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>wholesalers</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">”,
	be construed as requiring that preferential pricing only be extended
	to certain wholesalers and not to others.  Furthermore, the order
	only applies to wholesalers which were customers at a particular
	date.  Other customers wishing to enter the wholesale distribution
	market may thus be at a disadvantage and, in such event, the order
	would have the effect of restricting entry into the market.</SPAN></P>

	Competition Act.  What must be borne in mind is that the subject
	matter of this review is an interim order.  Such an order is by
	definition a temporary measure aimed at minimising damage prior to
	the final determination of the issues.  On the one hand the Tribunal
	is required to impose measures which are reasonably necessary to
	control damage either to the Complainants or to prevent the purposes
	of the Act being frustrated. On the other hand the Tribunal must
	avoid making a final decision in respect of the issues.  What is
	required is that a temporary regime be enforced which will as far as
	possible ensure fairness and minimise anti-competitive behaviour. 
	In balancing those aims the Tribunal may in certain circumstances
	have to endorse or indeed, enforce practices which are
	irreconcilable with the purposes as set out in sec. 2 of the Act.

	the Tribunal may have to introduce or to endorse on a temporary
	basis a scheme which displays anti-competitive elements simply
	because that scheme is in the opinion of the Tribunal </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>reasonably

	<SPAN LANG="en-GB">In every case in which an interim order is to be
	made, the very many factors which make up modern commercial trade
	practices have to be weighed against the purposes of the Act.  In so
	doing the Tribunal is bound to find tensions and it is the
	Tribunal’s task to consider them and to exercise a discretion in
	favour of what is fair in the circumstances.  Because the order is
	only a temporary order, and is made before a final determination of
	the issues, care ought to be taken to avoid excessive and
	irreparable harm to all concerned.  For this reason the preservation
	of a </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>status quo</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
	or the reversion to the </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>status ante

	least harmful and most practical solution on an interim basis.  The
	perpetuation of an apparently outlawed practice on an interim basis
	is not only unobjectionable but will, in many cases be inevitable
	or, simply the least of all evils.  When the matter is finally
	decided the Tribunal will be less constrained in ordering
	fundamental changes to uphold the central purposes of the Act.  I
	say “less constrained” because the potential for conflicts
	between the various purposes in sec. 2 of the Act is quite apparent

	the hearing, however, it was common cause that the matter should be
	remitted but Appellants argued that it should be sent back to the
	Tribunal as an institution as opposed to the panel which first heard
	and decided the matter.  Appellants contended that any rehearing had

	<SPAN LANG="en-GB">I have considered the arguments raised and cannot
	find any basis upon which to refuse to remit the matter.  Logically
	the resumption must be before the existing panel.  If any panel
	members are not available, then the Chairperson of the Tribunal will
	have to act in terms of sec. 31 of the Act.  In setting aside the
	decision and order in this matter the proceedings as a whole are not
	invalidated.  On the facts </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><I>in casu</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">,
	the hearing is put back to the stage which had been reached before
	the decision was made.  When the matter proceeds the Tribunal will
	have to decide upon the further procedural steps which it takes. 
	Without limiting or extensively defining the concerns which may
	arise, it appears that the panel may be faced with an application to
	re-open the matter in order to place further or updated information
	before it; it may itself require further argument in the light of
	this decision; it may be required to consider the complaints made in
	terms of secs. 5, 8 and 9 of the Act - matters which have not yet
	been decided and which fall essentially within the domain of the
	Tribunal.  The Tribunal has been empowered by the Legislature to
	determine the issues which arise in the sec. 59 application and,
	save in respect of the matters dealt with in this judgment, there is
	no basis for this Court to impose its own views, at this stage, as
	to what may be relevant or how the Tribunal should go about the
	further hearing of this matter.  Those decisions are, and at this
	stage, remain, the prerogative of the Tribunal. </SPAN>

	affidavits, strenuously resisted and opposed the review.  The
	question of a concession was again conditionally linked to a
	remittal when Complainants heads of argument were filed a week
	before the hearing.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that
	fairness demands that the costs follow the result.  Appellants have
	succeeded save in respect of the referral to the original panel.
