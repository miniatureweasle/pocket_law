# iteration one
# Jacob Fionn

comments on current system (Alfred):


FOCUS:

- iteration 1 focuses on core functionality
	- static generation of html files
	- working links
	- working menu 


Comments: CLIENT = ALFRED 

DATABASE:

- db can be built manually

UI:

- not the focus of iteration one
- will have to have style consistent accross all pages by iteration 3

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

- menus hardcoded can be predefined
- working links are satasfactory
- static generation works well for current database sample

SEARCH:

- searching not implemented
- expected to be working by iteration 2

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:

- increase database size for iteration two
- Alfred will deliver new database samples next week
- search functionality included
- static generation with whole database 
- needs to be generated in a reasonable amount of time
