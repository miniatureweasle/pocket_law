	<FONT SIZE=3>8.1. The facts of this case reveal that the dispute
	turned upon a refusal by the respondent to continue with appellants’
	guaranteed supply on the same terms and conditions. At the root of
	this litigation, there is a battle between the parties as to whether
	the appellant can demand a continued supply while simultaneously
	being entitled to resist an upward adjustment in the price of the
	supply.  </FONT>

	<FONT SIZE=3>8.2. The respondent has given an undertaking to
	continue supplying the appellant from its uncommitted volumes from
	other SAFCOL plantations, on the same basis and terms as other
	customers without long term contracts. The appellant would thus have
	to compete with these other customers.</FONT></P>

	8.3. On the interpretation that Section 8(d) does not constitute a
	<B>per se</B>prohibition as contended for by Mr Bowman, the question
	arises as to the existence of proof of an anti-competitive effect of
	a kind that can be distinguished from the consequences of a
	contractual dispute. In the context of a competition dispute based
	upon the provisions of the Act, the refusal to supply must be
	examined within the context of the concept of a prohibited practice.
	In this case  the appellant cannot simply claim that the actions of
	the respondent constituted a <B>per se</B>prohibition without
	providing proper evidence which showed that the requirements of the
	section had been met. For this reason, the Tribunal was correct in
	its finding that the act complained of has not been shown to extend
	the market power of the respondent <B>qua</B>competition with the
	appellant and that the actions complained of had not been shown to
	fulfil the requirements of a prohibited practice.</P>

	<FONT SIZE=3>8.4. In the light of the conclusion to which I have
	arrived, that the appellant had failed to show that a ‘refusal to
	supply’ scarce goods produced anti-competitive consequences, the
	appellant cannot succeed in obtaining the relief sought. Simply put,
	it has failed to show that the respondent was engaged in a
	prohibited practice. </FONT>

	<FONT SIZE=3>Although not strictly necessary for my finding, I agree
	with the view expressed by the Tribunal that there is “no doubt
	that the impact on the business of York of a reduction in the supply
	of raw material of this magnitude would be significant”. But the
	appellant can procure an equivalent of the “guaranteed volumes”
	from other SAFCOL plantations, by competing with other customers
	without long term contracts. Further, there is evidence to show that
	it could obtain some supplies from other plantations. </FONT>
