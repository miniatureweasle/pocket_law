<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">The distribution of
pharmaceutical products in South Africa has traditionally been the
business of pharmaceutical wholesalers. The wholesalers, who buy
products from the manufacturers at a general discount of 17,5%, sell
these products to pharmacists and other smaller buyers.  This system
changed when a joint exclusive distribution agency, International
Healthcare Distributors (IHD) was established by several
manufacturers and commenced business on 1 November 1993.  Wholesalers
found that the previous system changed after the establishment of IHD
as they could no longer purchase pharmaceutical products directly
from manufacturers who were members of IHD. Of major significance was
that these wholesalers no longer obtained the 17,5% discount.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In July 1998, 5<SUP>th</SUP>
to 13<SUP>th</SUP> respondent filed a complaint with the Competition
Board (which operated under the then Maintenance and Promotion of
Competition Act 96 of 1979, (the ‘old Act’)) alleging that IHD
and its members contravened the provisions of the this Act in forming
a joint exclusive distribution agency.  In 1997 the applicant
manufacturers came together under the so-called project NASA with the
intention of establishing a similar joint exclusive distribution
agency for their products.  They formed a company called the
Synergistic Alliance Investment (SAI) to acquire seventh applicant
(“DD”), a national full line wholesaler, with the intention of
converting it into a joint exclusive distribution agency.   DD and
the 13<SUP>th</SUP> respondent were the only national full line
wholesalers.  Presumably as a precautionary measure respondents
applied to the erstwhile Competition Board to have the project
exempted from the provisions of the old Act prohibiting horizontal
collusion on conditions of supply.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In February 1999 the
Board announced that it would conduct a formal investigation into
exclusive distribution agencies in the pharmaceutical industry
pursuant to a complaint against IHD.  It found that there was <U>prima
facie</U> evidence that restricted practices existed or could exist.
SAI announced that that it would not go ahead with its project until
the Board had issued its final report.  This was published in May
1999. The board found that the joint exclusive distribution agency
for pharmaceutical products would constitute a horizontal restricted
practice prohibited under the old Act.  The Board found that the
formation of a joint exclusive distribution agency in a
pharmaceutical market would have the effect of limiting distribution
facilities in the market, restricting entry into the wholesale
distribution market, maintaining or enhancing the prices or other
consideration for pharmaceutical products and preventing the
distribution of pharmaceutical products in the most efficient and
economic manner. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time the
Competition Commission was established in terms of the Act, the
Minister of Trade &amp;amp; Industry decided not to implement any
recommendations of the Board and thus declare exclusive distribution
agencies in the pharmaceutical industry to be unlawful. He considered
that the mechanisms provided under the new Act could resolve the
matter more effectively and that complaints could be pursued with the
Competition Commission.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In March 2000, SAI
announced that it had acquired DD and it would go ahead with its plan
to convert DD into a joint exclusive distribution agency for its
members’ products.  Manufacturers who were members of SAI would in
future sell all their products through DD. Ownership of the products
sold through DD would remain with the manufacturer until the sale to
relevant customer.  DD would take all orders and collect payments on
behalf of the manufacturers.  DD advised all the manufacturers’
customers of the change and attached a guide on how DD would operate.
Soon thereafter DD issued a single credit application form on behalf
of all the manufacturers to be completed by businesses wishing to
open accounts with DD to buy their products. At the same time DD
issued a single set of terms and conditions for the supply of the
manufacturers’ products.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pursuant to these
developments an application, in terms of section 59, was launched

made an order the terms of which have been set out above.</P>

In short Mr Loxton’s approach to the test that should be applied
before the court invoked its powers in terms of section 38 (2A)(d) of
the Act, namely the power to suspend the operation and execution of
an order that is the subject of a review or appeal, was to follow the
approach to stay applications developed in the common law. See, for
example,  <U>Safcor Forwarding  (Pty) Ltd v</U> <U>National 
Transport Commission</U> 1982(3)SA654(A) at 674-675; <U>Southern</U>
<U>Metropolitan Substructure v Thompson</U> 1997(2)SA799(W) at 805.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Mr Nelson, who
appeared together with Mr van Dorsten on behalf of respondents,
submitted that, in the exercise of its discretion to grant a stay,
the court must give careful consideration to the purposes of the Act.
In short the purposes of the Act would be frustrated if the interim
order granted by the Tribunal, after careful consideration of the
available facts, were to be suspended in circumstances, where the
review application is without substance, was launched merely to
confer jurisdiction on the court to hear the stay application and
represented a dilatory tactic that amounted to an abuse of the court
process. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"> In considering
such a decision, the court must balance the rights of an applicant to
a stay with those of the party in whose favour the section 59 order
has been granted by the Tribunal. Further the decision must take
place within the context of legislation designed to promote
competition. In this connection Mr Nelson cited Lewis P in <U>South
African Raisins (Pty) Ltd v SAD Holdings Ltd (Case No</U>.
<U>16/IR/Dec99),</U>  “our conclusion that an interim order in
terms of section 59 is not appealable serves to avoid an outcome that
would frustrate the whole purpose of providing an interim relief
remedy in competition matters. If the granting of the interim order
in terms of section 59 were appealable and the interim order stayed,
as is argued by the respondents, this would destroy the main object
of section 59 – to provide interim relief pending final
determination of the complaint following a full investigation by the
Commission”.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">For these reasons
Mr Nelson cautioned against the adoption of the same approach to stay
applications as developed in accordance with the common law in that
the fundamental question must always be whether or not the granting
of the stay would have the effect of advancing the purposes of the
Act. Accordingly he submitted that in the exercise of its discretion
the court should consider whether or not:</P>

<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">In my view, a
careful examination of the submissions made by both counsel reveals
that there was less of a difference between the approaches
respectively contended for by Mr Loxton and Mr Nelson than would
superficially appear to be the case.  In considering whether to grant
a stay, a conclusion that an applicant can show <U>prima facie</U>
that his or her rights have been infringed and that there is a
balance of convenience favouring the granting of such an order will
weigh heavily with a court in the exercise of its discretion.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">However in taking
this decision the court has a discretion to grant or refuse an
application to suspend an order.  As Traverso J said in <U>Santam
Limited</U> v <U>Norman and another </U>1996 (3)SA502(C) at 505 F “It
is a discretion which should be exercised judicially  but generally
speaking a court will grant a stay of execution where real and
substantial justice requires such a stay or where injustice would 
otherwise be done” see also <U>Strime v Strime</U> 1983(4)SA850(C)
at 852.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">The position can be
summarised thus: In exercising its discretion a court must, of
necessity, enquire as to whether there is a <U>prima facie</U> case
that an applicants rights have been infringed.  Further the court
must locate where the balance of convenience lies. But that is not
all that has to be considered in the exercise of   the discretion to
grant such an order. Within the context of the Act there is the
additional consideration that the suspension of an interim order in
terms of section 59 can, if granted too easily, subvert the very
purpose of an important provision of the Act which created this kind
of order. Hence the court must exercise its discretion by means of a
careful consideration of the policy considerations of the act in the
context of the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">If the test for the
successful application for a stay of the execution of a section 59
order nods too generously in favour of the applicant, Mr Nelson’s
contention that the granting of a stay would subvert the very purpose
of an order designed to ensure the promotion of pro-competitive
behaviour would be justified. For this reason a court must enquire as
to whether the applicant can show <U>prima facie</U> that its order
has infringed a right which applicant enjoys, further that the
balance of convenience favours the granting of such interim relief
within the context of the factual matrix of the case and that the
injustice caused by the perpetuation of the order would be greater
than the possibility of jeopardizing the purposes of the Act promoted
by the continuation of the section 59 order itself.</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">As set out above, applicants
submitted that there were a number of grounds on which the Tribunal’s
order could be justifiably reviewed. However in his argument to the
court, Mr Loxton concentrated attention on the vague and ambiguous
nature of the order.  He referred for definitional support  to the
decision in <U>Genticuro AG the</U> <U>Firestone  (SA) (Pty) Ltd</U>
1972(1)SA589(A) at 610 D  where Trollip  JA said,  vagueness 
connotes ‘being  not only of  double but also of indefinite meaning
which cannot be resolved with the requisite degree of certainty by
proper construction”.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">
Applying this definition, Mr Loxton submitted that the key paragraph
in the order of the Tribunal was incapable of being interpreted with
the requisite degree of certainty by means of a proper construction. 
That paragraph provided that the respondents supply their products
directly to the claimants and other wholesalers on terms and
conditions <U>similar to those that applied to transactions  between
them and the claimants and  other wholesalers</U> immediately before
the conversion of DD to a joint exclusive distribution agency for
their products (our emphasis) .</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Mr Loxton submitted
that the word ‘similar’ was a particularly difficult word to
interpret.  As Schreiner ACJ noted in <U>R v Revelas</U> 1959(1)
SA75(A) at 80B-C “obviously there are degrees of similarity or
likeness, some approaching, and exceptionally perhaps even reaching
sameness, others amounting to know more than a slight resemblance.
The similarity may be basic or superficial, general or specific. I do
not think that the words “a similar” in GN 363 should be given a
meaning “the same”.  That is at most a rare sense.  And moreover
the history of the Government Notices indicates that the word “same”
was abandoned in favour of “similar”. The change could hardly
have been designed to make it clear that sameness was intended:
rather it must been aimed at substituting the notion of resemblance”.

1972(3) SA841(O) at 842 E-F  Kumleben AJ(as he then was)said “Die

beperkende uitleg vatbaar is. Gevolglik kan daar  nie met sekerheid

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Mr
Loxton submitted that the approach adopted by Kumleben AJ was equally
applicable to the order of the Tribunal. The manner in which the
order had been framed left great uncertainty as to how terms of a
contract must be understood. For example did the qualifying word
‘similar’ relate only to an enquiry as to comparative price or to
other terms of the contract?  To what extent could terms be adjusted
to take account of external exigencies such as inflation?  Similarly
there was no clarity as to the meaning of a wholesaler as employed
within the context of the order. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"> Mr Loxton also
contended that the manner in which “wholesaler” was employed in
the offending paragraph led to uncertainty in that it was unclear
whether the class of person contemplated was limited to companies
registered with the South African Pharmaceutical Council as
wholesalers or whether it included all companies who purchase
applicants products. If it was only to include the former, then the
order was unclear as to whether the class included only full line
wholesalers such as respondents who offer a short line wholesalers. 
If it was the latter it was unclear whether the class was limited to
non retailers who purchase the principles products for on sale to
retailers or whether it also included retailers and retail buying
groups who purchase applicants products for sale to other retailers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Mr Loxton also
attacked the logic of the reasoning of the Tribunal in justifying the
grant of the order. In paragraph 67 of the Tribunal’s decision, Ms
Diane Terblanche writing on behalf of the Tribunal said: “the order
we have issued compels the respondent to supply the claimants and
other wholesalers on the same terms and conditions as before the
advent of DD”. By contrast the order which was granted referred to
terms and conditions “similar to those that applied to transactions
between them ….”</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Although applicants
have launched an application in terms of Section 66 of the Act to
have ambiguities in the order clarified, Mr Loxton submitted that
section 66 only empowers the Tribunal to clarify its decision and
vary its order if, on a proper construction, the meaning thereof is
ambiguous. However the Tribunal was not empowered to alter the
substance of the decision or order.  The ambiguity and/or vagueness
in the order was such that it could not be clarified without altering
the very intention of the Tribunal and for this reason any such
ambiguity or vagueness could not be cured in terms of section 66.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Applicants’
further submission that it was not granted a fair hearing in respect
of the relief granted in the order is relevant to this question.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of
paragraph 8 of the Notice of Motion for interim relief in terms of
section 59 of the Act, respondents approached the Tribunal for an
order in terms of which respondents would be ordered the continue
supplying their products to applicants on terms and conditions
identical to those given by respondents to DD.  This was the nature
of their case.  The deliberations before the Tribunal were predicated
upon this form of relief and there was no opportunity given to
applicants to provide their views on any alternative approach or
alternate relief of the kind which was granted by the Tribunal in
terms of its order. Were the Tribunal to have granted the relief
sought in paragraph 8 of the Notice of Motion, the relief which
should have been granted by the Tribunal was to order that applicants
were to continue to supply products to respondents on terms identical
to those given by applicants to DD.   
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">In his response, Mr
Nelson submitted that applicants were attempting to place imaginary
jurisprudential obstacles in respondents way by presenting certain
words as ambiguous rather than conceding that they admitted of some
surmountable interpretive difficulty. As Young J said in <U>R v
deKock</U> 1965(2)SA380(SR) at  384 C  “the fact that the true 
interpretation of an Order is a matter of difficulty and even great
difficulty does not necessarily imply that the Order is ambiguous for
the purposes of the ambiguity rule.  If I am driven to a particular
conclusion then for me there is no ambiguity”.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">For this reason Mr
Nelson submitted that the word ‘wholesalers’ could only
constitute a reference to wholesalers with whom the manufacturers
have engaged previously in business.  Accordingly it would include
both full and short line wholesalers.  There was evidence before the
Tribunal that the respondents were the only remaining full line
wholesalers.  There was therefore no need to make reference to other
wholesalers if the order was intended to refer only to full line
wholesalers.  On the assumption that the order incorrectly referred
to other wholesalers this should not be a basis for setting aside of
the order and in   particular depriving the wholesalers, to whom it
correctly referred, from obtaining interim relief.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of the
Concise Oxford Dictionary the word similar is defined as “of the
same kind, nature, or amount; having a resemblance (your house is
similar to mine; we have similar tastes)”.  Mr Nelson thus
submitted that in the context of the order, the word could be given
its dictionary meaning.  In short the Tribunal had made it clear that
what was meant was that applicants must sell on the same terms and
conditions as applied before the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of May 2000.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Relying upon a
purposive interpretation to the order, Mr Nelson submitted that the
Tribunal intended to restore the status quo to the fair competitive
environment that existed prior to the 29<SUP>th</SUP> of May 2000. 
This meant that manufacturers competed in setting blue book prices at
certain levels and wholesalers competed by passing on a portion of
the wholesaler margin.  To ensure that competition was restored
manufacturers were directed to restore the wholesalers’ ability to
compete with one another on an equal footing.  The decision of the
Tribunal thus recognized that the complaint that the manufacturers
had bandied together and tampered with existing price structures in a
manner that was uncompetitive. This conclusion was justified on the
evidence presented to the Tribunal and accordingly the order granted
was designed to restore the <U>status quo ante.</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Given these
competing arguments the test to be applied in granting such an order
becomes critical. While Mr Nelson correctly contended that it would
be improper to grant a stay in circumstances whether the review
application was without substance or formed part of dilatory tactics
which amounted to an abuse of the court process, most cases have more
distinct shades of gray. The essential question, within this factual
context, has less to do with these considerations and more with the
determination of how substantial the prospects of success in the
review application must be before a court will make an interim
decision of this nature.  Clearly the more substantial the prospects
of success may be in the review application, the greater the degree
of substantial injustice which would follow were the stay not to be
granted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">In my view,
applicants must show that they have a justifiable case, that is a
case which, on their papers, justifies a conclusion that a successful
review may be prosecuted. Expressed differently, the question that
arises is whether the court on the papers can reasonably come to the
conclusion that the application for review before another court may
be successful. In my view such a conclusion is justified in the
present case.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">The order was made
by the Tribunal and not a court. Thus the reliance by Mr Nelson on
<U>dicta</U> of Trollip JA in the <U>Genticuro</U> case cannot simply
be applied to the order of a tribunal. Although Mr Nelson also cited
<U>Frankel Max Pollak</U> <U>Vinderine Inc v Menell Jack Hyman
Rosenberg  and Co Inc</U>  1996(3)SA 355(A) at 362-363  as support
for his argument , this case(as with the others cited) dealt with the
award  of an arbitrator which was to be made an order of court. In
the present case, the problem is not only about ambiguity in that the
order granted not by a court employs a different formulation to the
relief sought in the notice of motion. In addition the order employs
different language from the very explanation given by the Tribunal as
to reasons for the order which it granted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">The case law cited
above reveals that it is a legitimate argument to contend that the
word ‘similar’ is ambiguous. Such a conclusion does not require a
process of creative lawyering to renders the word uncertain.  The
phrase “other wholesalers” may be interpreted in the manner
contended for by respondents but there is a legitimate argument
regarding the ambiguity of the phrase which renders this part of the
order itself vague and ambiguous. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">When the Tribunal
grants an order which is different from that contained in a notice of
motion great care should be given to its meaning and purport and
further there should be no inherent linguistic difficulty for the
parties being able to comply therewith.  The consequence of
non-compliance with such an order can be serious in that non
compliance can be visited with severe penalties.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">For these reasons I
find that on the ground of review for vagueness and ambiguity, these
is a clear basis for applicants to approach this Court for a stay.</P>

Passenger Service (Pty) Ltd Ramlagan</U> 1957(2)SA382(D) at 383F,
Holmes J (as he then was) said “by balance of convenience is meant
the prejudice to the applicant if the interdict be refused, weighed
against prejudice the respondents that it be granted.  In clarifying
the scope of this dictum Magid J said in <U>Verstappen v Port Edward
Town Board &amp;amp; Others</U> 1994(3)SA569(D and CLD) at 576 H  “I do
not believe that the learned judge intended to suggest that the
manner in which the grant or refusal of an interdict would affect the
immediate parties to the litigation was the only matter relevant to a
determination of the balance of convenience.  Where, as in this case,
the wider general public is affected, the convenience of the public
must be taken into account in any assessment of the balance of
convenience” see also <U>Corium (Pty) Ltd &amp;amp; Others in Myburgh

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">This latter <U>dictum</U>
supports the principle contained in the submission of Mr Nelson,
namely that in competition law the weighing up of the balance of
convenience does not depend only upon a consideration of the
interests of the immediate parties.  In considering the balance of
convenience, attention must also be given to the broader objective
sought to be achieved by the Act and whether there is clear evidence
that the conduct with which an applicant for such a stay wishes to
persist will be contrary to the purposes of the Act. This
consideration   must weigh heavily against such applicant
irrespective of the adverse financial consequences that the initial
order of the Tribunal may entail. Consequently Mr Nelson referred to
the reasons given by the Tribunal for the interim order, namely “if
we did not grant the interim order and the claimants subsequently get
a final order the competitive process and structure for the
distribution of the respondents manufacturers products would have
been so skewed in favour of DD and the respondents, that a final
order may not be able to adequately address the effects of DD’s
conversion on the nature of competition in the distribution market”.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Were
the prohibited practice allowed to continue the pattern of

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">For this reason Mr
Nelson submitted that it was clear that the Tribunal was mindful of
the fact that the anti-competitive arrangement that the applicants
set up resulted in a significant financial benefit to the applicants
that was derived directly from a reduced competition for the
distribution of their products and which rents, but for their
concerted action would in the ordinary course of business have
accrued to wholesalers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Mr Loxton submitted
that the applicants would suffer a severe and irrecoverable loss if
the order was not suspended pending review and applicants were in due
course successful in the application. The order was, in his view, so
vague that despite its best efforts applicants were unable to comply
therewith.  Accordingly they ran a risk of being found subject to
contempt of court proceedings and fined in terms of section 61 of the
Act. Mr Loxton contended that applicants expended approximately R39m
in converting DD into a distribution agent and upgrading its
infrastructure in distribution services with an additional project
cost of R51m being budgeted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">When the matter
came before the Court, Mr Nelson applied, at the proverbial eleventh
hour and somewhat tentatively, for leave to cross-examine certain
representatives of the applicants on the contents of certain
confidential affidavits setting out potential loss.  The confidential
affidavit, setting out respective financial positions of the parties,
provided competing versions of the financial loss which may be
suffered by the parties respectively were the Tribunal order to
continue in force on the one hand or be suspended on the other. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">These competing
versions notwithstanding, it is clear that, were the Tribunal’s
order to continue to operate, applicants would suffer significant
financial loss (although Mr Nelson did attempt, without clear
evidence to suggest that being part of multi-national giants
applicants loss was insignificant in relative terms). The Tribunal
found that ‘the manufacturers joint control of the distribution
agency ensures that rents derived from the reduced competition for
the distribution of their products accrue to them and not to some
independent third party. It thus effectively ensures a transfer of
these rents from the wholesalers to the manufacturers’. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Viewed in these
terms, this dispute turns on competing claims to the rents derived
from the distribution of pharmaceutical products.  No compelling case
was made out before the Tribunal (if its decision is any guide) or in
the papers before this Court as to the broader societal interest
particularly those of consumers whose interests may be affected by
the outcome of this dispute. The Tribunal was also not able to arrive
at a conclusion as to whether respondents would suffer serious,
irreparable damage were the order not to be granted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">It is likely that
there will be prejudice to both parties depending on the outcome of
this decision.  In the light of the clear case which applicants have
made out to justify an application for review to set aside the order
of the Tribunal and the further evidence which is available as to the
financial loss which could be suffered in the event that the order
continues, I am satisfied that the balance of convenience in the
specific context of this case sufficiently favours a granting of the
order as sought</P>
